# Clover and friends \[part 1\]...

For this part of the guide you'll install and prepare clover for the ramble.

1. Download the latest [Clover LZMA](https://github.com/Dids/clover-builder/releases/latest) from Dids' repo \(thanks bb ❤️\)
   1. For Windows, ~~use 7zip to extract the LZMA and TAR inside it until you get the iso~~
      1. No need to get it anymore, MakeInstaller will take care of clover installing, go to **Step 4: Open CLOVER** directly
   2. For linux, use p7zip or file roller or whatever you use, to extract the LZMA and TAR inside it until you get the iso
   3. For macOS, use `keka` \(google it\) or `The Unarchiver` \(AppStore, Free\) to extract the LZMA and TAR inside it until you get to the iso
      1. _Note for macOS users who want to use legacy on the destination machine:_
         1. If you're booting from UEFI on the destination go to **step 2: Mount the ISO** \(do not follow this note\)
         2. Download the pkg from the source above
         3. Open the installer
         4. Select the destination as "CLOVER" \(USB\)
         5. Select Customize
         6. Choose:
            1. Boot Sectors : Install boot0ss in MBR
            2. Clover for BIOS \(legacy\) booting: Clover EFI 64-bits SATA
            3. Themes: \(a theme, choose clovy\)
            4. BIOS Drivers, 64 bit: ApfsDriverLoader - AppleImageLoader
            5. Uncheck the rest of there is anything checked
         7. Install
         8. Go to **Step 7** bellow
2. Mount the ISO
   1. On windows 10, double click or Open With &gt; Windows Explorer
   2. On linux, use `mount` command with `-o loop,ro` or with `gnome-disks` by right-clicking the iso &gt; mount image 
   3. On macOS, double click
3. Copy the EFI folder from the ISO to the CLOVER USB
   1. you should have CLOVER \(USB\) &gt; EFI \(folder\) &gt; CLOVER & BOOT
4. Open CLOVER &gt; EFI &gt; CLOVER
5. delete `doc` and `OEM` and 
   1. UEFI users, delete:
      1. `drivers64`
   2. Legacy users, delete:
      1. `drivers64UEFI`
6. Clover Drivers \(EFI drivers, not to be confused with kexts, which are macOS drivers\)
   1. for UEFI users:
      * Open `drivers64UEFI`, _delete_ everything inside
      * go to `drivers-off > drivers64UEFI`, copy ApfsDriverLoader, AppleImageLoader,  AptioMemoryFix and HFSPlus to `drivers64UEFI` that we emptied earlier.
   2. for Legacy users:
      * go to `drivers-off > drivers64UEFI`, copy ApfsDriverLoader, AppleImageLoader and HFSPlus to `drivers64`
7. Go to kexts &gt; Other
   * Go to [Goldfish64's Kext Repo](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AiP7m5LaOED-m-J8-MLJGnOgAqnjGw)
   * Download these: _\[Note: Explore each folder and you'll find a Zip file, get that Zip file, not the whole folder\]_
     * _**FakeSMC**_ OR _**VirtualSMC**_ \(they both emulate an SMC system, though VSMC has quality code than FSMC, do not use both\)
     * _**Lilu**_ \(an arbitrary kext patcher\)
     * WhateverGreen \(has different fixes and patches for various GPU-related issues, depends on Lilu\)
     * _**USBInjectAll**_ \(Injects USB information, configuration is needed\)
       * Pair it with **FakePCIID+FakePCIID\_XHCIMux** if you're on a 5th gen laptop or 4th motherboard and earlier. 6th gen laptops or motherboards dont need it.
     * _**AppleALC**_ \(AppleHDA patcher for audio injection, depends on Lilu\)
     * _\[optional, for desktop, **CRUCIAL, for laptops**\]_ _**VoodooPS2**_ \(PS2 drivers, needed for laptops\)
     * For your LAN card:
       * **AppleIntele1000** for some old cards
       * [HoRNDIS](https://github.com/midi1996/JBOG/blob/master/Extra/HoRNDIS.kext.zip?raw=true) _\[ONLY IF YOU NEED NETWORK CONNECTION USING ANDROID\]_
       * **IntelMausiEthernet** for most Intel NICs
       * **AtherosE2200Ethernet** for some Atheros/QualcommAtheros/Killer\(some\) NICs
       * **BCM5722D** for Broadcom BCM5722 NetXtreme and NetLink family
       * **RealtekRTL8100** for 10/100 Realtek Cards \(Realtek FE\)
       * **RealtekRTL8111** for Gigabit Realtek Cards \(Realtek GbE\)
         * _Note: if you're not sure, LOOK FOR YOUR LAN CHIPSET AND CHECK THIS AGAIN._
     * _\[Exceptionally for WiFi-only users\]_ For your compatible WiFi Card:
       * USB Wifi Users: **NO \[wont work while the install, look for the driver after the install\]**
       * for Broadcom based chips _\(DW1550-DW1560-DW1830...\)_: AirPortBcmFixUp
       * for Atheros based chips _\(AR5B95/195/97/197, based on AR9280/AR9285 SoC\)_:
         * go to [https://github.com/RehabMan/HP-ProBook-4x30s-DSDT-Patch/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/RehabMan/HP-ProBook-4x30s-DSDT-Patch/archive/master.zip)
         * extract the zip
         * explore to `kexts`
         * get `ProbookAtheros.kext`
       * for QComAtheros: _NOPE_ - Change it \(check AR95/4XX bellow\)
       * for Intel: _NOPE_ - Change it
       * for Atheros based on _AR95XX-AR94XX_: ATH9KFixUp with proper boot argument options seen in the original github [repo](https://github.com/chunnann/ATH9KFixup) or rehabman's [fork](https://github.com/RehabMan/ATH9KFixup) \(ignore the fact that you need to install it under /S/L/E\).
8. Extract every zip
   * Note: a kexts is a macOS driver, and it's in a form of a `a_folder_name.kext`, on windows it will show as a folder, on macOS it will show as a file.
9. now copy VirtualSMC.**kext** \(or FakeSMC.kext\) - Lilu.kext - WhateverGreen.kext - USBInjectAll.kext - AppleALC.kext - \[your\_ethernet\_driver\].kext \(and any extra kext you needed from above\) and put it in _**CLOVER \(USB\) &gt; EFI &gt; CLOVER &gt; kexts &gt; Other**_. _\[skip the sensor kexts, they may cause kernel panics, aka KP. For VirtualSMC, copy over SMCProcessor if you want to, leave the rest out\]_
   1. _Basically what you should have in the end: \`_`- VirtualSMC.kext - USBInjectAll.kext - AppleALC.kext - Lilu.kext - WhateverGreen.kext - VoodooPS2Controller.kext (laptop users) - <SomeEthernetDriver>.kext`
10. now you're mostly done with Clover and macOS installer preparation.

Extra note for X299 people:

You need to add `GenericUSBXHCI` kext from the kext repository above, along VoodooTSCSync if you can't enable Core Syncing in your firmware, more on that [here](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/gathering-kexts#usb) \[USB\] and [here](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/how-to-build-your-own-imac-pro-successful-build-extended-guide.229353/) \[Go to the BIOS section, as it's the most important part of that whole talk\].

## Important

You must check _**\[MUST READ\] Config.plist Basics**_ section **before** getting to \[part 2\].
